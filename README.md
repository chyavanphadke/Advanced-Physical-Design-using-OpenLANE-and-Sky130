Workshop on: Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE Sky130

Openlane is a package of tools that consists of many tools needed for the overall process from Design to GDSII
location of the Openlane is in openlane_build_script/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

The basic idea of Openlane is to have a complete flow

## About The Project

This project gives you an overall idea of Openlane opensource PDK a tool developed from complete automated flow from RTL to GSDII based on several components like OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, etc. OpenLANE uses Skywater 130nm open-source PDK and can be used to produce hard macros and chips.

The main steps in the  [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit "Application-specific integrated circuit")  physical design flow are:

-   Design Netlist (after synthesis)
-   Floorplanning
-   Partitioning
-   Placement
-   Clock-tree Synthesis (CTS)
-   Routing
-   Physical Verification
-   Layout Post Processing with Mask Data Generation
